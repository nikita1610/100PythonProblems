Problem statement:
Bitonic Matrix


Input:
mat=[[2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ] 

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
If all the rows and the columns of the given matrix have elements in one of the following orders:

Strictly increasing
Strictly decreasing
Strictly decreasing followed by strictly increasing
Then the given matrix is said to be a Reverse Bitonic Matrix

All the rows of the given matrix forms an increasing sequence. 
All the columns of the given matrix {2, 1, 4}, {3, 2, 5}, {4, 3, 6} 
forms a decreasing followed by increasing sequence. 
Therefore, the matrix is Reverse Bitonic.
