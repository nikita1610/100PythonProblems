Problem statement:
Page Faults in LRU 


Input:
n=9
a=[5, 0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 0, 5]
cap=4

Output:
8

Explanation:
memory allocated with 4 pages 5, 0, 1, 3: page fault = 4
page number 2 is required, replaces LRU 5: page fault = 4+1 = 5
page number 4 is required, replaces LRU 0: page fault = 5 + 1 = 6
page number 1 is required which is already present: page fault = 6 + 0 = 6
page number 0 is required which replaces LRU 1: page fault = 6 + 1 = 7
page number 5 is required which replaces LRU 3: page fault = 7 + 1  =8.
