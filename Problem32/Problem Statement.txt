Problem statement:
Convert an array to reduced form

Input:  
[10,40,20,50]

Output:
[0,2,1,3]

Explanation : 
10 is the least element so it
is replaced by 0. 50 is the largest
element so it is replaced by 4-1 = 3. And
20 is the 2nd smallest element so it is
replaced by 1 and 40 is second largest so it is replaced by 2
