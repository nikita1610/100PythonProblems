Problem statement:
Given a list print all the peak elements

Input:  
[10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67]


Output:
20 90

Explanation : 
An array element is a peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbours. 
For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour.
The element 20 has neighbours 10 and 15, 
both of them are less than 20, similarly 90 has neighbous 23 and 67.
