Problem statement:

Write a program to find the lexicographically smallest and largest substring from given string ‘s’ of the length ‘k’


Input:
s="stack"

Output:
Lexicographically Smallest Substring: "ack"
Lexicographically Largest Substring: "tac"

Explanation:
Suppose you’re given a String s="stack" and given the integer k=3.
Here, integer k=3 denotes the length of  possible substrings from the given string .
The possible substrings would be : ["sta","tac","ack"]
And from these we can find the lexicographcally smallest and largest string
