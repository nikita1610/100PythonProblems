Problem statement:
Merge Overlapping Intervals


Input:
[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10]]

Output:
[[1,6],[8,10]]


Explanation:
Here intervals [1, 3] and [2, 6] overlaps. So we can merge these two intervals. 
The resultant interval after merging is [1, 6].
Interval [8, 10] does not overlap. So it will be as it is.
